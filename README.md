# WorldQuant-Data-Science-Program
Here you can find all the 8 projects of WorldQuant's Data Science Program along with my certification. 

I'm exhilarated to share that I have successfully completed WorldQuant's Data Science Program, a transformative journey that has broadened my skills and knowledge in the field of data science! üéì ‚ú® 





Throughout the program, I had the opportunity to work on eight fascinating projects, each designed to enhance my understanding and practical application of key data science concepts. Let me provide a brief explanation of each project:



1Ô∏è‚É£  Project 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - I delved into datasets, uncovering patterns, trends, and relationships to gain valuable insights for decision-making.



2Ô∏è‚É£ Project 2: Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering - I learned techniques to clean and transform raw data, ensuring its suitability for modeling and analysis.



3Ô∏è‚É£ Project 3: Regression Models - I built regression models to predict and explain numerical outcomes, leveraging algorithms like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.



4Ô∏è‚É£ Project 4: Classification Models - I explored classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines to solve problems involving categorical outcomes.



5Ô∏è‚É£ Project 5: Time Series Analysis - I mastered the art of analyzing and forecasting time-dependent data, using techniques like ARIMA, SARIMA, and Prophet.



6Ô∏è‚É£ Project 6: Dimensionality Reduction - I employed methods like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and t-SNE to simplify and visualize high-dimensional data effectively.



7Ô∏è‚É£ Project 7: Clustering - I explored unsupervised learning techniques to identify natural groupings within data, using algorithms like K-Means and DBSCAN.



8Ô∏è‚É£ Project 8: Neural Networks and Deep Learning - I delved into the world of neural networks, building and training models using popular frameworks like TensorFlow and Keras.



I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to WorldQuant for providing an exceptional learning experience. The program's comprehensive curriculum and hands-on projects have equipped me with practical skills and a deep understanding of data science techniques.
